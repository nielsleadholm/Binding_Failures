# Binding_Failures
This MATLAB code is used to study coincidence-detecting networks that model feature binding, and what conditions cause them to fail.

The files included here are:

Jitter_Sim.m simulates the effect of spike time jitter on the frequecy of illusory conjunctions.

Distance_Sim.m simulates the effect of spatial disparity on the frequecy of illusory conjunctions.

Repeats_Sim.m simulates the effect of repeated features on the frequecy of illusory conjunctions.

Fixation_Sim.m simulates the effect of retinal fixation on coincidence detection.
